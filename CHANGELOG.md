# 2.0.0

## What's Changed
### Breaking Changes
* Remove `future` package.  Move package contents to `transaction`.
* Remove `MakeLogicSigAccount` and replace with `MakeLogicSigAccountEscrow`. Mark `MakeLogicSig` as a private function as well, only intended for internal use.
* Rename `SignLogicsigTransaction` to `SignLogicSigTransaction`.
* Remove logicsig templates, `logic/langspec.json`, and all methods depending on it.
* Remove `DryrunTxnResult.Cost` in favor of 2 fields: `BudgetAdded` and `BudgetConsumed`. `cost` can be derived by `BudgetConsumed - BudgetAdded`.
* Remove v1 algod API (client/algod) due to API end-of-life (2022-12-01). Instead, use v2 algod API (client/v2/algod).
* Remove unused generated types:  `CatchpointAbortResponse`, `CatchpointStartResponse`.
