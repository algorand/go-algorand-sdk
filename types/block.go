		// Rewards.
		//
		// When a block is applied, some amount of rewards are accrued to
		// every account with AccountData.Status=/=NotParticipating.  The
		// amount is (thisBlock.RewardsLevel-prevBlock.RewardsLevel) of
		// MicroAlgos for every whole config.Protocol.RewardUnit of MicroAlgos in
		// that account's AccountData.MicroAlgos.
		//
		// Rewards are not compounded (i.e., not added to AccountData.MicroAlgos)
		// until some other transaction is executed on that account.
		//
		// Not compounding rewards allows us to precisely know how many algos
		// of rewards will be distributed without having to examine every
		// account to determine if it should get one more algo of rewards
		// because compounding formed another whole config.Protocol.RewardUnit
		// of algos.

		// Consensus protocol versioning.
		//
		// Each block is associated with a version of the consensus protocol,
		// stored under UpgradeState.CurrentProtocol.  The protocol version
		// for a block can be determined without having to first decode the
		// block and its CurrentProtocol field, and this field is present for
		// convenience and explicitness.  Block.Valid() checks that this field
		// correctly matches the expected protocol version.
		//
		// Each block is associated with at most one active upgrade proposal
		// (a new version of the protocol).  An upgrade proposal can be made
		// by a block proposer, as long as no other upgrade proposal is active.
		// The upgrade proposal lasts for many rounds (UpgradeVoteRounds), and
		// in each round, that round's block proposer votes to support (or not)
		// the proposed upgrade.
		//
		// If enough votes are collected, the proposal is approved, and will
		// definitely take effect.  The proposal lingers for some number of
		// rounds to give clients a chance to notify users about an approved
		// upgrade, if the client doesn't support it, so the user has a chance
		// to download updated client software.
		//
		// Block proposers influence this upgrade machinery through two fields
		// in UpgradeVote: UpgradePropose, which proposes an upgrade to a new
		// protocol, and UpgradeApprove, which signals approval of the current
		// proposal.
		//
		// Once a block proposer determines its UpgradeVote, then UpdateState
		// is updated deterministically based on the previous UpdateState and
